Here's a list of my current artistic output!

## concert music

### the lonely communist sorrow (string quartet, 2017)

This is what i consider to be my fist actual piece; it was premiered by the **[Kalimera Quartet](https://www.facebook.com/tomaz.piressoares.5)** in 2018. **[Here's the premiere](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmVFpan-_lU)**, and **[here's the score following video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMmAPBRj-k8)**

I had just learned about serialism, but my knowledge ended on the twelve-tone matrix. So, I developed a weird way of creating harmonies using the row, and the result was this piece.

I'm really proud of it.

### mozão e eu (acoustic guitar, 2020)

A piece based on two bars of Mozart's Eine Kleine Nachtmusik (yes, the two bars you're thinking of). I used a lot of processes and weird techniques to come up with this result, that was premiered by the incomparable **[Fabio adour](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4ZhijE9myRsySJYRaZXpJA)**. **[Here's the premiere](https:\\www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWHJuHgGwUk)**, and **[here's the score following video.](https:\\www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrLT5cld6g)**

### uma ready-made sonata (electric bass, 2021)

This piece was written at the request from **[Marcel Castro-Lima](https://castrolima.com/)**, to contribute to his Doctoral research; Marcel created a sort of archetypical definition of a sonata, and tasked several composers with writing a piece matching this definition. **[This is the result i came up with :)](https:\\www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6gmxbgT9WI)**

### telema (four appropriate instruments to be played remotely or not, 2022)

A fun little piece written for a class I took with Tatiana Catanzarro and Pedro Bittencourt as the tutors. This piece is meant to be played via Zoom (or Skype, or Google Meet, there's no sponsorships here). **[Here's the class's realization.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhYV_K_8EjA&ab_channel=PedroFaria)**

## bands, improvised stuff

### japanese grind (free improvisation)

Weird noises, improvised stuff, poetry being created on the spot. We have a **[spotify](https:\\open.spotify.com/artist/7bcdki0wCpOK6SFrIM2g70?si=7ua_PX_pRoynQrk8rKwdKg&utm_source=whatsapp&dl_branch=1)** and a **[YouTube channel.](https:\\www.youtube.com/channel/UCEELlEyjU_QREDwguWgvytg)**.

### my solo weird electronic stuff (well...weird electronic stuff)

Just me goofing around, being a little goofy goober. **[Bro, check out my soundcloud.](https://soundcloud.com/pedrofaria89)**

## writing

### benjamin (eraserhead press, 2015)

My only book (so far), this is a work in the **[Bizarro Fiction genre](https://www.bizarrocentral.com/)**. You should definitely **[check it out](https:\\www.amazon.com/-/pt/dp/B0172PA8VG/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_pt_BR=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&dchild=1&keywords=benjamin+pedro+proen%C3%A7a&qid=1630590754&sr=8-1)** (and also the genre in general) if you like stuff like Alice in Wonderland, David Lynch movies, Adult Swim's weird infomercials.
