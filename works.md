here's a list of my current artistic output!

### concert music

#### the lonely communist sorrow (string quartet, 2017)

this is what i consider to be my fist actual piece; it was premiered by the **[kalimera quartet](https://www.facebook.com/tomaz.piressoares.5)** in 2018; **[here's the premiere](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmVFpan-_lU)**, and **[here's the score following video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMmAPBRj-k8)**

i had just learned about serialism, but my knowledge ended on the twelve-tone matrix; so, i developed a weird way of creating harmonies using the row, and the result was this piece.

i'm really proud of it.

#### mozão e eu (acoustic guitar, 2020)

a piece based on two bars of mozart's eine kleine nachtmusik (yes, the two bars you're thinking of); i used a lot of processes and weird techniques to come up with this result, that was premiered by the incomparable **[fabio adour](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4ZhijE9myRsySJYRaZXpJA)**; [here's the premiere]**(https:\\www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWHJuHgGwUk)**, and **[here's the score following video.](https:\\www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzrLT5cld6g)**

#### uma ready-made sonata (electric bass, 2021)

this piece was written at a request from **[marcel castro-lima](https://castrolima.com/)**, to contribute to his doctoral research; marcel created a sort of archetypical definition of a sonata, and tasked several composers with writing a piece matching this definition; **[this is the result i came up with :)](https:\\www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6gmxbgT9WI)**

#### telema (four appropriate instruments to be played remotely or not, 2022)

a fun little piece written for a class i took with tatiana catanzarro and pedro bittencourt as the tutors; this piece is meant to be played via zoom (or skype, or google meet, there's no sponsorships here); **[here's the class's realization.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhYV_K_8EjA&ab_channel=PedroFaria)**

### bands, improvised stuff

#### japanese grind (free improvisation)

weird noises, improvised stuff, poetry being created on the spot; we have a **[spotify](https:\\open.spotify.com/artist/7bcdki0wCpOK6SFrIM2g70?si=7ua_PX_pRoynQrk8rKwdKg&utm_source=whatsapp&dl_branch=1)** and a **[youtube channel.](https:\\www.youtube.com/channel/UCEELlEyjU_QREDwguWgvytg)**.

#### my solo weird electronic stuff (well...weird electronic stuff)

just me goofing around, being a little goofy goober; **[bro, check out my soundcloud.](https://soundcloud.com/pedroproenca)**

### writing

#### benjamin (eraserhead press, 2015)

my only book (so far), this is a work in the **[bizarro fiction genre](https://www.bizarrocentral.com/)**; you should definitely **[check it out](https:\\www.amazon.com/-/pt/dp/B0172PA8VG/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_pt_BR=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&dchild=1&keywords=benjamin+pedro+proen%C3%A7a&qid=1630590754&sr=8-1)** (and also the genre in general) if you like stuff like alice in wonderland, david lynch movies, adult swim's weird infomercials.
