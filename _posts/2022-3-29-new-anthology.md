title: i have a story coming out on an anthology!
---

<p>After a good while, I have a story coming out in a new anthology.</p>

<img src="/images/anthology_cage.jpg" alt="nick cage anthology cover">

<p>I really should be writing. I really like writing, and when i'm in the zone doing it, I actually write really quickly. But, I have serious attention problems, it's hard for me to actually sit down and do stuff.</p>

<p>But, I wrote a little something for this anthology, run by my good friend <a href="https://twitter.com/G_S_Ball">Leigham Shardlow</a>, who runs the UK based Bizarro Fiction press <a href="https://twitter.com/press_parrot">Ex-Parrot Press</a>. This anthology is called <em>His Soul's Still Dancing<em>, and all the stories are inspired by the absolutely insane character that is Nicolas Cage.

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/press_parrot/status/1504914374263193610/photo/1">Here's the list of authors</a> on this beautiful piece of work. My story is called <em>The Story of the Shaman</em>, and it's a little surrealist piece involving a hermit in the woods and some girl scouts trying to sell him cookies. It's a lot of fun! </p>

<p>Anyways, I will write more. I like it, I'm confident enough that I'm at least one step above mediocre at it, and it makes me feel good when I click on that last <em>save</em>.</p>
