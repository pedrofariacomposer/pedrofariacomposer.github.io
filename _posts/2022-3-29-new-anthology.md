title: i have a story coming out on an anthology!
---

<p>after a good while, i have a story coming out in a new anthology.</p>

<p><img src="/images/images/anthology_cage.jpg" alt="nick cage anthology cover"></p>

<p>i really should be writing; i really like writing, and when i'm in the zone doing it, i actually write really quickly; but, i have serious attention problems, it's hard for me to actually sit down and do stuff.</p>

<p>but, i wrote a little something for this anthology, run by my good friend <a href="https://twitter.com/G_S_Ball">leigham shardlow</a>, who runs the uk based bizarro fiction press <a href="https://twitter.com/press_parrot">ex-parrot press</a>; this anthology is called <em>his soul's still dancing<em>, and all the stories are inspired by the absolutely insane character that is nicolas cage.

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/press_parrot/status/1504914374263193610/photo/1">here's the list of authors</a> on this beautiful piece of work; my story is called <em>the story of the shaman</em>, and it's a little surrealist piece involving a hermit in the woods and some girl scouts trying to sell him cookies; it's a lot of fun! </p>

<p>anyways, i will write more; i like it, i'm confident enough that i'm at least one step above mediocre at it, and it makes me feel good when i click on that last <em>save</em>.</p>
