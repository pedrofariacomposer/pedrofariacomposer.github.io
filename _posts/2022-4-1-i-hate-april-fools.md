title: i hate april fool's day
---

<p>I hate April Fool's, and not just because of the "practical jokes" aspect of it. It's also the anniversary of the coup d'Ã©tat
which transformed my country in a military dictatorship that killed and tortured hundreds of people. It was a dark time in our History, that
it's still celebrated by many on political right.</p>

<p>Also, on an April Fool's day when I was a teen, I was fake mugged on the street. The guy approached me, said he had a gun on his bag, asked me for my phone. I gave it to him, 
he looked at it, said "nevermind", and walked away.</p>

<p>Safe to say no one believed me in school that day.</p>

<p>I guess I just don't like the kind of jokes that usually get thrown around on this day. It's not my style.</p>

<p>Not to say I don't like jokes in general, far from it. In fact, want to hear my favorite joke ever? It's from the movie <em>Kung Pow.</em></p>

<p>What do you get when you cross an owl with a bungee cord?</p>

<p><em>My ass.</em></p>

<p>Anyways kids, fake mugging teens is bad. Military dictatorships are also bad. Hell, the political right is also Bad, with a capital b.</p>

<p>Catch you later.</p>
