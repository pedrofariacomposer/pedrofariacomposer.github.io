### academic stuff

i have a bachelor's degree in mathematics from rio de janeiro state university (uerj, 2013), and a master's degree from rio de janeiro federal university (ufrj, 2022), where i studied under prof. liduino pitombeira.

also i've studied with arthur kampela and wladimir tourinho.

i began my musical life as a bassist for several bands here in rio, and only after having graduated from college for 4 years that i discovered myself as a composer, at age 28.

my interests are algorithmic composition, compositional systems, systemic modelling, and writing everything in lower case.
