his music is described by the rats on his walls as "please, don't put us through this again, we don't like answering questions"; and by his close family as "yeah, sounds good".
            
he lives in rio de janeiro with his wife, their pets and the aforementioned interview-hating rats.

### academic stuff

i have a bachelor's degree in mathematics from rio de janeiro state university (uerj, 2013), and a master's degree from rio de janeiro federal university (ufrj, 2022), where i studied under prof. liduino pitombeira.

i began my musical life as a bassist for several bands here in rio, and only after having graduated from college for 4 years that i discovered myself as a composer, at age 28.
